# Notes App description

This is a simple notes taking app built using React. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and search for notes. Each note consists of a title and text content. The notes are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist across page reloads. Users can easily navigate through their notes using pagination, with the ability to view a limited number of notes per page. The app also supports live searching, enabling users to quickly find notes by title or content. It is a great tool for organizing and managing personal notes efficiently.
